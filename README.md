Workout Tracker is a simple webstie that allows fitness beginners to learn more about fundamental home exercises they can perform with their own bodies and basic equipment. The app also gives users the power to organize their own workouts and track their progress. This will help them reach their goals and become more accustomed to the world of fitness.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node).

npm init, npm install express, npm install nodemon -g, npm install method-override, .gitignore

# User Story
The user is someone who is looking to get into shape in the comfort of their own home with basic gym equipment. He or she is someone who wants to learn more about their bodies and athleticism and save money rather than paying for gym memberships.

# Programming issues
Solving the back-end codign was difficult, so I definitely had to reach out to others for assistance. The complexity of it required me to simplify my app and go somewhat off course from my original wireframes and ERD's, but I think I still learned a lt about back-end programming in the end. An unsolved problem that I have is the edit feature, since it takes me to a strange page where things seemingly restart. Additionally since I focused so much on the back-end, I only had little time to work on the front-end, so that will definitely be something to work on in the future.
